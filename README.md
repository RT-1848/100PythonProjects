# 100 Python Projects!

Welcome! This repository is a personal challenge to complete **100 Python projects** with the goal of leveling up my Python skills and gaining a deeper understanding through hands-on learning.

I’ll start by creating small projects ranging from beginner-friendly to more advanced as a way to apply what I’ve learned, explore new libraries, and grow as a developer.

## Goals
- Strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals and OOP
- Practice writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
